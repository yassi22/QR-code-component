## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

 

### What I learned

What is learned was that it is pretty hard to copy a design and code it. This is my first time ever doing it
but is was a nice challenge. 
 
 

### Continued development

I want to refine my css skilss because flexbos is still kinda my weak point
